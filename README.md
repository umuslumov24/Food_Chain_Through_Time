# Food Chain Through Time ⏳ 
**Turn-based grid simulation game with AI-driven predator–prey dynamics and era-specific abilities.**

---

## 📖 Overview

Food Chain Through Time is a Java-based strategy / simulation game modeling predator–prey interactions across different eras.

Animals compete on a grid using movement, special abilities, and AI-driven decisions. Each era introduces unique mechanics that influence strategy and gameplay dynamics.

The project emphasizes object-oriented design, modular architecture, and behavioral simulation.

## 🎮 Gameplay Concept

The game takes place on a grid where entities act turn-by-turn:

- **Prey** search for food  
- **Predators** hunt prey  
- **Apex Predators** dominate the ecosystem  

Each animal features:

- Standard movement  
- Special abilities  
- Cooldown mechanics  
- AI behavior

## ✨ Features

- Turn-based grid system  
- AI-controlled entities  
- Predator–prey mechanics  
- Era-specific abilities  
- Scoring system  
- Cooldown system  
- Entity respawn logic  
- Modular OOP design  

---

## 🧠 AI Behavior

Animals make decisions based on environmental factors:

- **Prey** balance survival & food seeking  
- **Predators** optimize hunting & safety  
- **Apex Predators** maximize dominance

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project follows a modular object-oriented design:

- `animals/` → Animal types & abilities  
- `entities/` → Food & grid entities  
- `main/` → Core game logic  
- `exception/` → Custom exceptions  
- `load/` → Game configuration / loading
